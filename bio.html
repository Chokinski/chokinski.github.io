        <h2 class = "hStyle">About Me</h2>
        <p class="pStyle animate slideFromTop animate--slow"> I'm a 4th year undergraduate computer science student looking to finish my degree at 
            Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. Though aspiring to be a very well-rounded Full-Stack Software Engineer, I'd best classify myself now as a Java
            Software Engineer in terms of experience. For my ideal future, I'm looking to create software utilizing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605294/" target= "_blank"> Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983091/#Sec15title" target= "_blank"> Machine Learning</a>, 
            and blockchain technology for <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/14/5/295#sec7-information-14-00295" target= "_blank">Decentralized Software</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class = "hStyle animate animate--medium">Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="pStyle animate slideFromTop animate--medium">In my free time if I'm not working on projects such as JATbot, I'm either watching Vikings on netflix(w show), hanging out with childhood friends
             or researching information regarding anything tech.

        <h2 class = "hStyle animate animate--slow">Childhood</h2>
        <p class="pStyle animate slideFromTop animate--fast"> Born in Georgia yet raised in
            Willimantic, Connecticut, I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to talk with people from most societal classes and all walks of life. As in return, 
            I've gained a personality with perspectives that aren't restricted to one side, I'm simply very open-minded and eager to hear all sides of a topic.
            
        As a child,
            my love for the computer science field developed from playing games like Minecraft on our dell all-in-one
            desktop computer. Since then, I've been fascinated with the capabilities of computers and how I could use them to create and control things.
            I want to create something that progresses humanity forward in some way while helping people in their daily lives.
